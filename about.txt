Me: I need to study in order to advance my career in web development.
Also me: *spends all my time making 'The Great Ace Attorney' content*
Solution? This.

I am Ceri, a front end web developer in Devon, UK, although many people in the TGAA fandom will know me as CherryLestrade on Youtube, Twitter and Reddit. 

This meme generator was made by myself as a passion project in order to practice Javascript as well as learning a few new things along the way. I use Javascript often in my day job, but it is often simple things so I had a lot of fun creating something on this scale. It was built in raw HTML, CSS and Javascript, the headers are added using Jekyll (which frankly is probably overkill for a single page site, but I'd never used it before and wanted to try it out), and hosted on Github pages (again, something I'd never used before and am amazed how easy it is - I highly recommend).

I would sincerely love to see any memes you create with this. Do tag me on Reddit or Twitter if you share them!

More about 'The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles'
'The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles' is a two part visual novel game by Capcom, who own the rights to all character, location and interface artwork on this page. It is honestly the best game I have ever played and I am obsessed with it despite the fact I finished it months ago.

About me:

I am Ceri, a software engineer in Devon, UK, although many people in the TGAA fandom will know me as CherryLestrade on Youtube, Twitter and Reddit. I am OBSESSED with The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.

At the time I started this project I was a front end developer working for a web design agency. I got to do little fun bits like this here and there but never anything on this scale. I started this project both as a way to build my skills and portfolio in the hope that I would land myself a job doing this kind of thing, and fuel my TGAA addiction while I was at it. I am pleased to report that:
- It worked! I have a new job doing this kind of thing. I even included this project on my CV.
- The addiction is still going strong.

The takeaway here is that TGAA made my life better, and it can make your life better too!

The technical details:

This project was built using HTML, CSS and vanilla old-school Javascript, which was all I knew at the time I started this project. Since then I've become familiar with React, Handlebars, Typescript and more, and the urge to do a massive rewrite is strong. However, I've decided to leave it as it is to show that in this age of endless libraries and frameworks, you can still achieve it all in bog-standard JS. 

This project is hosted on Github Pages, which I'd not used before but highly recommend.
